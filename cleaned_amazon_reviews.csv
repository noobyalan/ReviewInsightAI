0,Anyone who likes this better than the Pekinpah is a moron.,"All the pretty people in this film. Even the Rudy character played by Michael Madsen. This is adapted from a Jim Thompson novel for cryin' out loud! These are supposed to be marginal characters, not fashion models. Though McQueen and McGraw were attractive (but check out McQueen's crummy prison haircut) they were believable in the role. Baldwin and Bassinger seem like movie stars trying to act like hard cases. Action wise, the robbery scene in the Pekinpah version was about 100 times more exciting and suspe","Anyone who likes this better than the Pekinpah is a moron. All the pretty people in this film.

1,Cool product until the cats lost it . . . .,"My cats seemed to be amused to work for their food. One cat would roll the ball with her paws and nose, and the other would walk behind her and eat up whatever fell out -- teamwork! I knew they'd dig this ball because I had already made something similar out of a plastic water bottle before that they liked a lot.A few weeks after getting this, though, the ball was never to be found again. I think it may have rolled down into the dark basement at some point and became one with the clutter.+1 for the adjustab","Cool product until the cats lost it . . . .

1,Works as expected,"I've had no problems running this with my Dell 8200 PC running Windows XP Home Edition which is running an addon USB 2 card, to which this hub (I have the 8 port version) is connected.

1,Not a bad deal...,"If you're considering purchasing this movie, I have to figure you're either a huge fan of Sarah Michelle Gellar, or you've seen the movie in the past and really liked it.

1,nasty,"In 1880s Australia, a lawman makes a deal with a bandit to bring his murderous brother to justice. Simple story about the brutality of frontier life has direction, cinematography and characters reminiscent of the best 60s spaghetti westerns such as ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" (1969). Viewers may also enjoy the similar-styled ""The Three Burials of Melquiades Estrada"" (2005) and ""No Country for Old Men"" (2007).","nasty In 1880s Australia, a lawman makes a deal with a bandit to bring his murderous brother to justice.

1,A great comfortable pump.,"This is a wonderfully comfortable and good looking pump especially if you're looking for a slightly wider toe box. It looks great with a skirt or slacks. My only complaint is that after finally accepting that a wide width is the most comfortable, and kindest to my feet, I can't find my size (6.5 W) in navy. I have the shoe in black. If anyone from Naturalizer is reading this message; how about making more sizes and colors in wide widths available?","A great comfortable pump.

0,Disappointing considering all the high ratings,Gruen writes like a woman who is trying to sound like a man. Her word choice and syntax did not ring true and unfortunately the method cost her some in credibility. The book was nothing to write home about and certainly did not rank with anything by Erik Larson. The high ratings from other reviewers are puzzling.

1,Step up to this plate,"For fans of dub as well as jungle and drum & bass, dubstep is a terrific combination of these genres.

1,Great travel pack,"This bag is nearly perfect. The straps easily tuck away, which is great when using the pack as carryon luggage for a flight or on a train.

I just spent two months backpacking in India and the bag still looks new.","Great travel pack This bag is nearly perfect.

0,Very disappointing,"Sorry to say, this movie was a disappointment. Harrison Ford was not at his best, I expected better. He did not make a convincing cowboy. The Indians seemed to be rather lame in the movie. The characters were not well developed at the beginning of the story. A boring movie, the plot was not well done. The only decent part of the movie were the special effects, especially when some of the actors did their own stunts.","Very disappointing Sorry to say, this movie was a disappointment.

McCarthur is very diligent in studying the Bible and all types of resources surrounding it such as history, Greek, Hebrew, other Christian works, secular works, etc. Not a big fan of NASB or NKJV of the Bible, though many prefer them. In some cases the reading is more difficult. For example (NASB then KJV) magi-wise men, dissipation-riot, sordid-filthy, diadems-crowns. Obviously there are examples where the opposite is true also. Another place to look at some NASB changes is hissheep.","Good Study Bible Very good study Bible.

0,Moon Pool and cave diving,"I bought this book without very high expectations, because it was apparently published originally as a mass-market paperback. But I'd been told it had a hi-tech cave-diving theme, and it did turn out to mention several cave-divers I know. (But the scene is really a flooded mine.) It's not a mystery; you find out whodunit on the first page of the first chapter. I guess it's a suspense thriller. I found it readable, but the author's inclusion of lots of unnecessary facts in an effort to show off his research ","Moon Pool and cave diving I bought this book without very high expectations, because it was apparently published originally as a mass-market paperback.

I just finished reading ""Forget You Had a Daughter"" by Sandra Gregory and I found it to be one scary book. Young people take a lot of chances and this young lady took one too - big mistake. She should have just called home and asked her parents for money. That's what parents are there for (I'm a parent, and I know!). I enjoyed the book immensely and felt badly for the author who lost a lot of years in her young life to prison. Glad that she's doing well now and has moved on! On a lighter note, my daughter w"

1,Suprisingly strong story with unique claymation format,"A ""claymation"" Jesus? How's that going to work? Surprisingly well! While artistic license is taken (if you're looking for the real deal, read the New Testament), this ranks up there with films like Franco Zeffirelli's 1977 ""Jesus of Nazareth"" (seriously!). Caution to parents with young children: it has some very intense scenes and should defintely be viewed by parents FIRST. Well done, it was first shown on ABC Sunday night of Easter several years ago.","Suprisingly strong story with unique claymation format A ""claymation"" Jesus? How's that going to work?

0,Don't bother,"I'll keep it short--Don't bother. Compared to other recent games like Jedi Knight 2, etc, this game is 5 years behind the times. The game engine is a clunker and the controls do not allow you to respond at the same rate as your adversaries.

0,Get the full sized one instead,"I liked these little zippos years ago so i bought one again. Disappointment. Get the full size one instead.

0,MORE LIKE UNPRACTICAL MAGIC,"I finished this book in about 3 days realizing that the only thing that was noteworthy was the fact I had lost 3 days in my life to which I could have been reading something that was worthy of my time rather than wasting my time on this book. I read the book and saw the movie at the same time. If Hoffman had written a book with the same heart as the movie, maybe then I would not be so harsh.

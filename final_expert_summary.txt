Positive Feedback - Highlights:
the Outsiders The book was written by a 16 year old girl named S.E. Hinton. the pictures in the book have a special glossy cover, which makes them look very good.

Negative Feedback - Issues:
this is adapted from a Jim Thompson novel for cryin' out loud. the book contains nothing unique or original. it is safe and conforming and devoid of originality. it reminds me of a religious sermon.
